This pen is designed to use absolute positioning and to use the CSS z-index property to create layers for the screen display.

The screen is behind a layer of glass. Please give contributions to the screen display a z-index of between 3 and 99. This ensures that they will be shown beneath the glass and on top of the display background.

The screen is 1600px by 900px. The left edge is 120px from the left of the scene and the top edge is 120px from the top of the scene.

The taskbar has a z-index of 95 and is 50px wide.
